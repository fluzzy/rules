# Archive Format Template

Every archived document MUST follow this format:

```markdown
# Title

> **Source**: [Source Name](url)
> **Author**: Author Name (if known)
> **Archive Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

Brief 1-2 sentence introduction explaining what this document covers.

---

## Section 1

Content organized by topic with clear headers.

## Section 2

Use tables, code blocks, and lists for clarity.

---

## References

- [Full citation with link](url)
```

## Rules

- Start with a markdown heading (`# Title`)
- Include source attribution in blockquote format immediately after the title
- Include archive date (use today's date)
- Add author if identifiable
- Use `---` horizontal rules to separate major sections
- End with a References section linking back to all source material
- Keep content structured: prefer headers, bullets, and tables over long paragraphs
- Summarize clearly but preserve key details, data points, and actionable advice
- If the source has code examples, preserve them
- Target length: 50-200 lines (adjust based on source complexity)
