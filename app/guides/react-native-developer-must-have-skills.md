## What is React Native?

An open-source JavaScript framework by Meta for building cross-platform UIs (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS). Used by Facebook, Instagram, Flipkart, Uber, Skype, and Walmart.

**Key benefits:**
- Cross-platform from a single codebase
- Faster and more cost-effective than native development
- Responsive UIs with reduced load times

## 7 Essential Technical Skills

### 1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React Fundamentals

JavaScript is the foundational language for cross-platform development. React and React Native are distinct technologies — knowledge of both is valuable for building reusable, maintainable components.

### 2. React Native Framework Expertise

Hands-on experience is crucial. Build small projects to understand framework functionality, layout principles, and practical implementation beyond theory.

### 3. Platform Experience (iOS, Android, Windows)

Working knowledge of target platforms is essential. Understanding platform-specific behaviors, guidelines, and constraints enables better cross-platform decisions.

### 4. Third-Party Dependencies and APIs

Many features require third-party integrations beyond the core framework. Knowledge of REST APIs, native APIs, and third-party libraries is necessary for real-world cross-platform apps.

### 5. Development Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Redux** | State management for client and server-side |
| **Jest** | JavaScript testing framework for codebase correctness |
| **ESLint** | Identifies and reports JavaScript code issues |
| **ES6+** | Modern JavaScript features (arrow functions, destructuring, modules) |

### 6. Testing and Debugging

Debugging skills to identify and fix issues across platforms. Test code under various scenarios to ensure consistent functionality.

### 7. Performance Optimization

The most critical skill. Applications must perform optimally under all conditions — loading time, redirect speed, refresh rates, and resource usage all matter.
